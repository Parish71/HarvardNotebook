SyntaxError ->  print("hello", world) -> When you ussomething that the sintax dont accept.
This case -> print("hello, world")

ValueError -> x=int and you send a string on the program. number.0.0.py run on int numbers
But cannot receive a string like "cat"

keyword - try and except

NameError: Local Varibles and Global Variables. You basicaly send a invalid datatype for the x

In number 0.4 we have a infinite loop for dont accept the wrong data type. Until you put an integer is a loop.
